chmod: This is the command used to change file mode bits (permissions).
755: This is the octal representation of the permissions being set, broken down as follows:
7 (Owner): This grants the file's owner read, write, and execute permissions. In binary, 7 is 111, where each 1 represents a permission (read=4, write=2, execute=1). 
5 (Group): This grants the group associated with the file read and execute permissions, but no write permissions. In binary, 5 is 101.
5 (Others): This grants all other users on the system read and execute permissions, but no write permissions. In binary, 5 is 101.
In summary, when you apply chmod 755 to a file or directory:
The owner has full permissions: read, write, and execute.
The group associated with the file has read and execute permissions. 
Other users: on the system have read and execute permissions.
This is a common permission setting for executable files and directories that you want to make publicly readable and traversable, but only modifiable by the owner.


Understanding the 644 numeric code:
Permissions in Octal: Linux file permissions are represented by a three-digit octal number (like 644). Each digit corresponds to a specific set of users:
Owner: The first digit represents the permissions for the file's owner.
Group: The second digit represents the permissions for the group associated with the file.
Others: The third digit represents the permissions for all other users on the system.
Permission Values: Each permission type (read, write, execute) has a numerical value:
Read (r): 4
Write (w): 2
Execute (x): 1
Calculating the Digits: The digits in 644 are calculated by summing the numerical values of the desired permissions for each user category:
Owner (6): Read (4) + Write (2) = 6. This means the owner has both read and write permissions.
Group (4): Read (4) = 4. This means the group has only read permissions.
Others (4): Read (4) = 4. This means all other users have only read permissions.
In summary, when you execute chmod 644 filename:
The owner of filename can read and write to the file.
The group associated with filename can only read the file.
Other: users on the system can only read the file. 
This permission setting is commonly used for regular text files or configuration files where the owner needs full control, but others only need to view the content.
